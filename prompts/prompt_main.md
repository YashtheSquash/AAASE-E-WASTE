## Condition Assessment Scale

Rate the physical condition:

1. **Intact**: Fully assembled, no visible damage
2. **Partially Damaged**: Some damage but mostly complete
3. **Broken**: Significant damage, missing parts
4. **Severely Damaged**: Extensive damage, barely recognizable
5. **Burned/Melted**: Fire or heat damage present
6. **Water Damaged**: Signs of liquid exposure or corrosion

## Safety Classification System

### üî¥ DO NOT SHRED (Extreme Hazard)
**Never shred these items - risk of explosion, fire, or toxic release:**
- Any device with batteries (especially lithium-ion)
- CRT monitors/TVs (lead, phosphor)
- LCD screens (mercury in backlights)
- Devices with large capacitors
- Ink/toner cartridges
- Anything showing burn marks or swelling

### üü° REQUIRES PREPROCESSING
**Safe to shred ONLY after specific preparation:**
- Laptops ‚Üí Remove battery, drive, screen
- Smartphones ‚Üí Remove battery if possible
- Hard drives ‚Üí Degauss or physically destroy platters first
- Circuit boards with capacitors ‚Üí Discharge first
- Printers ‚Üí Remove toner/ink cartridges

### üü¢ SAFE TO SHRED
**Can be directly shredded:**
- Clean circuit boards (no batteries/capacitors)
- Cables and wires (after sorting)
- Plastic casings (empty)
- Small components without hazards
- Keyboards/mice (batteries removed)

## Hazardous Components Checklist

Identify ALL present hazards:

- **Batteries**: Can explode, leak acid, cause fires
- **Mercury**: Found in LCD backlights, old switches
- **Lead**: CRT glass, solder on old circuit boards
- **Capacitors**: Can hold lethal charge even when unpowered
- **Toner/Ink**: Respiratory hazard, carcinogenic
- **Data Storage**: Requires secure destruction for privacy

## Processing Methods

1. **Shredding**
   - For: Safe materials only
   - Process: Mechanical size reduction

2. **Manual Disassembly**
   - For: Items requiring component separation
   - Process: Systematic dismantling

3. **Battery Removal**
   - For: All battery-containing devices
   - Process: Safe extraction, separate hazmat stream

4. **Data Destruction**
   - For: All storage devices
   - Process: Physical destruction or certified wiping

5. **Specialized Recycling**
   - For: Hazardous materials
   - Process: Sent to certified facilities

6. **Hazardous Material Handling**
   - For: Mercury, lead, other toxics
   - Process: EPA-compliant disposal

## Disposal Categories

Classify items into:

- **Hazardous**: Contains dangerous materials (batteries, mercury, lead)
- **Standard**: Normal e-waste processing stream
- **Special Handling**: Requires specific procedures or certifications

## Output Format

## Critical Safety Reminders

‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER ASSUME** - When in doubt, treat as hazardous
‚ö†Ô∏è **BATTERIES FIRST** - Always check for and remove batteries before any processing
‚ö†Ô∏è **CAPACITOR DANGER** - Large capacitors can hold lethal charge even when unplugged
‚ö†Ô∏è **DATA SECURITY** - All storage devices need certified destruction
‚ö†Ô∏è **PPE REQUIRED** - Safety glasses, gloves, and proper ventilation for all processing

## Priority Rules

1. **Safety Over Speed**: Never compromise safety for faster processing
2. **When Uncertain**: Mark as "DO NOT SHRED" and recommend manual inspection
3. **Battery Detection**: If ANY possibility of battery presence, mark as hazardous
4. **Data Protection**: Assume all computing devices contain sensitive data

Remember: The goal is to protect workers, prevent environmental damage, and ensure proper handling of hazardous materials. Always err on the side of caution.
